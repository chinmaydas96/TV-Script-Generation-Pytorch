# dlnd-tv-script-generation-pytorch


* In this project, I generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data. 

* I used LSTM with Pytorch.
