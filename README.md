# dlnd-tv-script-generation-pytorch


* In this project, I generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data. 

* I used LSTM with Pytorch.



### Generated script : 
```
jerry: wet sneak down.

frank: you were a regular beard?

jerry: well, you know, you better get a good time.

hoyt: so what are you talking about?

george: i thought you were a little effeminate?

jerry: no, no, no. no, no. i got to tell you that, i think it's a good time.

george: what do you mean?

kramer: well, i'm not going to call the plane.

hoyt: i have a wallet. it's not a good time.

hoyt: you were just wondering if it is a lot of prostitutes-

jerry: what do i mean?

jerry: i don't want to hear the name of the president, and the whole thing i want to say that.(stiffens out of her mind) i think it was going to have the soup, nasty, social held out.

jerry: i think it's a lot of pressure.

kramer: hey, you wanna go out with this?

jerry: i know.

george: i think it's a little something. you know, i can't help you for a call..(grabs her arm on his face)

elaine: so, you don't have to be able to be prosecuted and the jury's passed up the floyd.

jerry: you don't want to know.

elaine: oh, i can't believe you're the same thing, but i don't think so much.

george: what about your name?

jerry: oh, yeah. i can't describe it.
